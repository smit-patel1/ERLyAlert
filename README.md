# ERLyAlert

**ERLyAlert** is a predictive health analytics platform that forecasts emergency room (ER) visit surges using time series models and real-time external data. By analyzing historical admissions alongside dynamic factors such as weather conditions, flu activity, and local events, ERLyAlert aims to help hospitals and emergency planners proactively manage staffing, resources, and logistics in high-risk periods.

## Project Overview

ERLyAlert provides:

- A 7-day forecast of ER visits
- Automated alerts for high-risk days
- Analysis of contributing factors driving predicted surges
- A web-based dashboard for interacting with forecasts by location and date
- A prompt-based query option for natural language input

The platform is built to support emergency planning teams by delivering actionable insights through a lightweight, intuitive interface.
